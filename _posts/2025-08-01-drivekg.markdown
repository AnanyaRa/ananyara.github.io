We present a heterogeneous knowledge graph framework for integrating multi-omics data from multiple independent datasets. By training a link prediction model to suggest candidate SNP-endometriosis associations, we identify biologically distinct signals that are related to in-
flammatory pathways and well-established co-morbidities of endometriosis, but not previously associated with endometriosis itself.
