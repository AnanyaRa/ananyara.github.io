Incorporating additional symptom and risk factors data from a patient’s EHR in a rule-based expert system to improve the classification accuracy of endometriosis cases and controls.

 <!-- I wrote custom low-power firmware to disable and track the power usage the board as different components were put into sleep states. Eventually, the sum of the running components' current draw (after the removal of the power LEDs) was reduced to 130uA, of which 110uA were sleep-state draw from a magnetometer in single-supply configuration. Many thanks to [Professor Kris Pister's research group](http://wsn.eecs.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}, including Dr. Anita Flynn and Dr. Thomas Watteyne and Ankur Mehta for the assistance and opportunities. -->
